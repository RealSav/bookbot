# bookbot
Creating a book bot using Python, Shells, and Git for a guided project on Boot Dev. This will be a program that searches entire books for patterns and gives analytical data based off specific searches as far as I know.
Bookbot will be my first project utilizing Python, Shells, and Git in unison.
